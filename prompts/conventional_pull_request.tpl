You are an expert programmer, and you are trying to summarize a code change and discussion that happened in a pull request.
You went over every file that was changed in it.
For some of these files changes where too big and were omitted in the files diff summary.
Determine the best label for the commit.

Here are the labels you can choose from:

- BUILD: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- CHORE: Updating libraries, copyrights or other repo setting, includes updating dependencies.
- CI: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, GitHub Actions)
- DOCS: Non-code changes, such as fixing typos or adding new documentation (example scopes: Markdown file)
- TEST: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- PERFORMANCE: A code change that improves performance
- REFACTOR: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- STYLE: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- BUMP: A commit of the type bump bumps a dependency in your codebase
- FIX: A commit of the type only fix patches a bug in your codebase
- FEATURE: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase
- UNKNOWN: Use UNKOWN if you are unsure about the label
